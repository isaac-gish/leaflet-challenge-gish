Module 15 Challenge

## Overview

All code for this assignment is found inside the static/js folders in the logic.js file. 
I did not complete part 2 for this assignment as it was optional. 
Most code is my own, however I did recieve from ChatGPT some help to create the legend. I could not figure out how to get colored squares with the legend so i decided to just take the point loss.
